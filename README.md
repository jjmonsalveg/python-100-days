# Python 100 days of code

## Setup

1. Install pyenv and pyenv-virtualenv
2. Install Python 3.12.3

```bash
pyenv install 3.12.3
```

3. Create a virtual environment for the project

```bash
pyenv virtualenv 3.12.3 python-100-days
```

4. set as local python version

```bash
pyenv local python-100-days
```

## Environments

We are going to use the python-100-days virtual environment for the project.
We are going to create a folder per day and in case we need to install
something really different to the virtual environment global for the project
then we can create a new virtual environment for that day.
